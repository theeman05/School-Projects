There are two supported ways to impliment `RedBlackDbTree` on Roblox.

For my examples, `RedBlackDbTree` will be installed to `ReplicatedStorage` or accesed via `require`. The module may be installed anywhere as desired, though.

### Method 1: Roblox's built in `require` method

- Inside your script, you can `require` the module directly.

### Method 2: Model File (Roblox Studio)

- Download the rbxm model file from the [RedBlackDbTree GitHub](https://github.com/theeman05/School-Projects/tree/main/Personal/RedBlackDbTree)

- Insert the model into Roblox Studio in a place like `ReplicatedStorage`
