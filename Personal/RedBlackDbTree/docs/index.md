RedBlackDbTree is a tweaked [Red-black tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red%E2%80%93black_tree). I have created it because from my knowledge, there isn't any available, efficient sorting data structures on Roblox already.

If you find any issues, or if something is incorrect, [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/theeman05/School-Projects/issues)!

RedBlackDbTree Time complexity:

| Function | Amortized | Worst Case |
|----------|-----------|------------|
| Search   | O(1)      | O(1)       |
| Add      | O(1)      | O(log *n*) |
| Delete   | O(1)      | O(log *n*) |
