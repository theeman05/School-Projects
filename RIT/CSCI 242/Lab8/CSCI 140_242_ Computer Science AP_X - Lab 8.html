<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lights_Out_(game)">Lights Out</a>
     is an electronic game in which the player attempts to turn off every light on a 5x5 board according to one simple rule: whenever a light it changed by the player, the adjacent lights are also changed.
</p>

<p>
    In this lab you will enhance a text-based Lights Out program by
    creating a graphical user interface (GUI) for the game so that a user
    can play a single person version of the game by clicking on buttons.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>In-Lab Portion</h2>

<p>
    As usual you have a portion of the lab due early.
    The instructions can be found
    <a href="https://www.cs.rit.edu/~csapx/Labs/08-LightsOutGUI/inlab.pdf">here</a>.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Implementation</h2>
You will finish implementing <code>LightsOutGUI</code> that you started in the in-lab.


<h3>Java Documentation/Code</h3>
<p>
    In the preliminary lab assignment, you
    were provided with a complete implementation of the model and a
    text-based user interface. <em>The provided classes should not be modified except the model's <code>updateTile()</code> which you were instructed to finish for the in-lab.</em> 
    </p><p>
    The GUI design is entirely up to you; however, it is suggested that you look at the implementation of <code>LightsOutTUI</code> to understand how to interact with the model. The <a href="https://www.cs.rit.edu/~csapx/Labs/08-LightsOutGUI/doc/index.html" target="_blank">documentation</a> for the following classes will also be particularly helpful. Note that documentation has only been generated for public fields and methods that will be used by the GUI.
</p>
<ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.cs.rit.edu/~csapx/Labs/08-LightsOutGUI/doc/model/LightsOutModel.html" target="_blank"><code>LightsOutModel</code></a>:
        The game model.
    </li>
    <li><a href="https://www.cs.rit.edu/~csapx/Labs/08-LightsOutGUI/doc/model/Tile.html" target="_blank"><code>Tile</code></a>:
        Represents an individual light on the board.
    </li>
    <li><a href="https://www.cs.rit.edu/~csapx/Labs/08-LightsOutGUI/doc/model/Observer.html" target="_blank"><code>Observer</code></a>: The interface for
        observers of the model.
    </li>
    <li><a href="https://www.cs.rit.edu/~csapx/Labs/08-LightsOutGUI/doc/tui/LightsOutTUI.html" target="_blank"><code>LightsOutTUI</code></a>:
        The plain text UI game.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    The text-based game <code>LightsOutTUI</code> has a main class
    and can be run directly.
</p>

<h3>Specifications</h3>
Below are the minimum requirements for your GUI:
<ul>
	<li> The layout should include:
	<ul>
		<li> A title bar with "Lights Out" as the title.</li>
		<li> A 5x5 grid of clickable lights </li>
		<li> Buttons for asking for hints, starting a new random game, and loading a game from a file. </li>
		<li> Text display(s) for indicating the number of moves made in the current game and to display any messages</li>
		<li> A way of displaying a hint; this could be achieved through a text box, highlighting a light, or any other way you wish as long as it is intuitive. </li>
	</ul>
        </li><li> The user must be able to interact with the light by clicking them. </li>
        <li> The difference between a light being on versus being off should be intuitive. You do this with colored tiles or you may choose to use images instead. </li>
        <li> The move counter should reset when a new game starts</li>
        <li> The user should be informed via a text display of the following:</li>
       	<ul>
       		<li>A new game starting</li>
   		<li>Failure to load a file.</li>
   		<li>The player has won the game.</li>
   	</ul>
	<li> The user should be able to start a new game (load or generate a random game) at anytime.</li>
	<li> The hint button should use the model's <code>getHint()</code> method.
	</li><li> Starting a new random game should use the model's <code>generateRandomBoard()</code> method.
	</li><li> Files should be loaded using the <code>FileChooser</code>.
	</li><li> There is no specification for the state of the game when the application is first started. It can always default to the same board, generated a random one, or even prevent the player from interacting until they choose to either load a game or start a random one.
	</li></ul>
<p></p>

<p>
    <a href="https://www.cs.rit.edu/~csapx/Labs/08-LightsOutGUI/images/demo.mp4" target="_blank">Here</a>
    is a video that shows many of the game's features.
</p>



<h3>Using the FileChooser </h3>
The <a href="https://openjfx.io/javadoc/19/javafx.graphics/javafx/stage/FileChooser.html"><code>FileChooser</code></a> provides a graphical way for a user to select a file from their computer which is then returned as a <code>File</code> object. Using it is fairly simple, a simple example is shown below.  The one thing you will have to figure out is how you plan on passing the <code>stage</code> you were using in <code>start()</code> to the <code>showOpenDialog</code>. 

<pre><code>
//create a new FileChooser
FileChooser fileChooser = new FileChooser(); 
fileChooser.setTitle("Load a game board.");
//open up a window for the user to interact with.
File selectedFile = fileChooser.showOpenDialog(stage); 
</code>
</pre>

If you wish, you can specifies the initial directory that the fileChooser displays:
<pre><code>
//set the directory to the boards folder in the current working directory
fileChooser.setInitialDirectory(new File(System.getProperty("user.dir")+"/boards"));
</code>
</pre>
You can also filter the files so only certain file extensions show up.
<pre><code>
fileChooser.getExtensionFilters().addAll( new FileChooser.ExtensionFilter("Text Files", "*.lob"));
</code>
</pre>
