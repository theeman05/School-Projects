<h2><a name="introduction">Introduction</a></h2>

<p>
    The toys in <em>ToyLand</em> yearn to be played with.  The more they are played with, the happier
    they become, until one day they reach their maximum happiness level and retire off
    to toy heaven.  In this lab you will develop a Java program that leverages inheritance to
    help the toys achieve their hopes and dreams.
</p>

<p>
    Before working on this assignment, you must have completed the problem solving work!
</p>

<h2><a name="design">Design</a></h2>

<p>
    As you do the work described in the rest of this document, you must follow the supplied public design
    for this lab.  This class diagram details all the classes and their relationships.
</p>

<h2><a name="requirements">Requirements</a></h2>

Unlike previous weeks when you were given supporting Javadocs, there are none for this assignment.
The non-private requirements for the classes are described here and should be reviewed frequently
as you develop your classes.

<h3><a name="itoy">IToy</a></h3>

<p>
    <b>IToy</b> is an interface for the public behaviors of <b>Toy</b>.  It is used by
    the Junit tests, and the main program.
</p>

<h3><a name="toy">Toy</a></h3>

<p>
    <b>Toy</b> is the abstract superclass of the toy inheritance hierarchy.  All toys
    must inherit from it to obtain the following behaviors:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>A constructor that takes the product code and name.</li>
    <li><b>getProductCode()</b>:  Returns the unique integer product code of the toy.</li>
    <li><b>getName()</b>: Returns the name of the toy.</li>
    <li><b>getHappiness()</b>:  Returns the toys happiness (starts at INITIAL_HAPPINESS and increases when played with).</li>
    <li><b>isRetired()</b>:  A toy is retired when its happiness level reaches/exceeds MAX_HAPPINESS (starts as not retired).</li>
    <li><b>getWear()</b>:  Returns the toys current wear amount (starts at INITIAL_WEAR and increases when played with).</li>
    <li><b>increaseWear()</b>  Increase the wear by the amount passed in.</li>
    <li><b>play()</b>: When played with, the following things happen in order:
        <ol>
            <li>
                A playing message is displayed to standard output in the format (## is the number of minutes):
            <pre>                PLAYING(##): toy-toString
            </pre>
            For example:
            <pre>                PLAYING(40): Toy{PC:100, N:Play-Doh, H:0, R:false, W:0.0}, PlayDough{C:GREEN}
            </pre>
            </li>
            <li>
                The special play is invoked for the same number of minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                The happiness of the toy increases by the number of minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                If the happiness of the toy reaches or exceeds MAX_HAPPINESS, the toy retires
                and displays a message to standard output in the format:
            </li>
            <pre>                RETIRED: toy-toString
            </pre>
            For example:
            <pre>                RETIRED: Toy{PC:100, N:Play-Doh, H:101, R:true, W:5.050000000000001}, PlayDough{C:GREEN}
            </pre>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li><b>specialPlay()</b> Each toy has its own defined behavior when being played with and is therefore abstract here.</li>
    <li>
        <b>toString()</b>:  Returns a string representation of the toy in the format (must be exact):
        <pre>            Toy{PC:?, N:?, H:?, R:?, W:?}
        </pre>
        <ul>
            <li><b>PC</b> for product code</li>
            <li><b>N</b> for name</li>
            <li><b>H</b> for current happiness</li>
            <li><b>R</b> for retired (true or false)</li>
            <li><b>W</b> for current wear</li>
        </ul>
        For example:
        <pre>            Toy{PC:100, N:Play-Doh, H:40, R:false, W:2.0}
        </pre>

                </pre>
                    For example:
                    <pre>                    Wall-E is running around with total distance: 700
                </pre>

            <li>The batteries are used for the amount of time.</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>toString()</b>:  Returns a string representation in the format:
        <pre>            Toy{PC:?, N:?, H:?, R:?, W:?}, BatteryPowered{BL:?, NB:?},  Robot{F:?, D:?}
        </pre>
        <ul>
            <li>The Toy part of the string comes from <b>Toy</b>'s <b>toString()</b></li>
            <li>The BatteryPowered part of the string comes from <b>BatteryPowered</b>'s <b>toString()</b></li>
            <li><b>F</b> for flying or not (true or false)</li>
            <li><b>D</b> for distance</li>
        </ul>
        For example:
        <pre>            Toy{PC:503, N:IronGiant, H:73, R:false, W:50.0}, BatteryPowered{BL:3, NB:12}, Robot{F:true, D:1825}
        </pre>

<p>
    You should see the following in the project window:
</p>

<img src="./Lab 4 Instructions_files/project_structure_initial.png" <="" img="">

<p>
    There are three packages in the <b>src</b> folder:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <b>test</b>: JUnit test files for the five toys.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>toyland</b>: The package for the main program, <b>Toyland</b>.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>toys</b>:  The entire inheritance hierarchy for the toys,
            along with a <b>ToyFactor</b> for making the toys.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    You are being provided with all the run configurations for running the main
    program, and running all the JUnit tests for the toy hierarchy.
</p>

<img src="./Lab 4 Instructions_files/run_configurations.png" <="" img="">

<h3><a name="inlab">In-Lab Activity</a></h3>

<p>
    The goal of the In-Lab activity is to begin developing the toy hierarchy.  You
    are required to fully implement:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <a href="https://www.cs.rit.edu/~csapx/Labs/04-Toyland/Toyland.html#itoy" target="_blank">IToy</a>: The public Toy interface used by the JUnit tests,
        the toy factory, and the main program.
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="https://www.cs.rit.edu/~csapx/Labs/04-Toyland/Toyland.html#toy" target="_blank">Toy</a>:  The abstract superclass of the entire toy hierarchy.
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="https://www.cs.rit.edu/~csapx/Labs/04-Toyland/Toyland.html#playdough" target="_blank">PlayDough</a>:  A concrete toy that can be made and played with.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    In addition, you will be required to stub out the remaining classes in the Toy hierarchy
    so that all the JUnit tests run.
</p>

<p>
    Stubbing means we only care about providing the correct
    signatures of the public methods the tester uses.  We do not care about making
    this class function correctly yet.  That will come later once we can compile cleanly.
    Do not worry about adding state to these classes yet.  Using the provided UML
    class diagram in the <a href="https://www.cs.rit.edu/~csapx/Labs/04-Toyland/Toyland.html#design">design</a> section above, <b>stub out all the concrete
    toy classes</b>.

</p><ul>
    <li>
        Constructors and methods that do not return anything do not need any code in their body and
        can remain empty.
    </li>
    <li>
        Methods that return something need a single statement that returns something in order to compile.
        It is suggested you return the following based on the return type:
        <ul>
            <li>For integers and doubles return <tt>0</tt></li>
            <li>For booleans return <tt>false</tt></li>
            <li>For objects, e.g. <tt>String</tt>, return <tt>null</tt></li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    Your final project structure should look like the following
    when finished:
</p>

<img src="./Lab 4 Instructions_files/project_structure_final.png" <="" img="">

<p>
    Only <b>TestPlayDough</b> is required to run correctly
    and it is expected to pass all tests.
</p>

<img src="./Lab 4 Instructions_files/test_play_dough.png" <="" img="">

<p>
    Keep in mind that only the public behaviors and constants are being provided you
    in the <a href="https://www.cs.rit.edu/~csapx/Labs/04-Toyland/Toyland.html#design" target="_blank">Design</a>.  You must provide the
    private state on your own.
</p>

<p>
    Also one final note about the JUnit tests.  Because of the statics that are used for
    the product codes, you should not run the entire suite of tests together.  Only run
    each test individually or else you will see some differences.
</p>

<h5>Design Reminder</h5>

<p>
    The <a href="https://www.cs.rit.edu/~csapx/Labs/04-Toyland/images/toyland_uml.png" target="_blank">UML class diagram</a> gives you
    direct hints about where to put your private state.  The presence of an accessor and/or
    mutator means the private state must go in that class.  <b>It is very important
    that you do not replicate state in subclasses!  For example, the name of each
    toy belongs in the <b>Toy</b> class.  If it needs to be accessed (or modified)
    in a subclass, the subclass should use the appropriate superclass accessor/mutator.</b>
</p>

<p>
    <b style="color:red">The use of <tt>instanceof</tt> anywhere in this assignment is strictly prohibited!</b>
        The natural polymorphic behavior of the toys must be adhered to throughout the entire
        implementation.
</p>

<h4>In-Lab Submission</h4>

<p>
    Make sure you commit and push your work to GitHub once you finish the in-lab.
</p>

<p>
    Once you have completed implementing <b>IToy</b>, <b>Toy</b> and <b>PlayDough</b>,
    you should zip up your entire <tt>src</tt> folder,
    name it <tt>lab4-inlab.zip</tt>, and submit it to the dropbox on MyCourses by the due date.
</p>

<h3><a name="lab">Lab Activity</a></h3>

<p>
    The full lab implementation is broken into two parts:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Finish implementing the remaining toys in the hierarchy.</li>
    <li>Complete the main program that runs the simulation.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Completing the Toy Hierarchy</h4>

<p>
    We suggest you follow this order for completing the toy hierarchy.  As you develop
    each new class make sure to verify it with the corresponding JUnit test before
    moving on to the next class.
</p>

<ol>
    <li><a href="https://www.cs.rit.edu/~csapx/Labs/04-Toyland/Toyland.html#doll" target="_blank">Doll</a>:  Tested by <b>TestDoll</b></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.cs.rit.edu/~csapx/Labs/04-Toyland/Toyland.html#actionfigure" target="_blank">ActionFigure</a>:  Tested by <b>TestActionFigure</b></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.cs.rit.edu/~csapx/Labs/04-Toyland/Toyland.html#batterypowered" target="_blank">BatteryPowered</a>:  Abstract superclass inherited by <b>RCCar</b>
    and <b>Robot</b></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.cs.rit.edu/~csapx/Labs/04-Toyland/Toyland.html#rccar" target="_blank">RCCar</a>:  Tested by <b>TestRCCar</b></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.cs.rit.edu/~csapx/Labs/04-Toyland/Toyland.html#robot" target="_blank">Robot</a>:  Tested by <b>TestRobot</b></li>
</ol>

<h4>Completing the ToyLand</h4>

<p>
    The next activity is finishing the implementation of the main program, <b>Toyland</b>,
    so the toys can be created and played with.
</p>

<p>
    The <a href="https://www.cs.rit.edu/~csapx/Labs/04-Toyland/data" target="_blank">data</a> directory contains various data files representing the various
    toys used in the simulation.
</p>

<img src="./Lab 4 Instructions_files/data_files.png" <="" img="">

<p>
    The <a href="https://www.cs.rit.edu/~csapx/Labs/04-Toyland/output" target="_blank">output</a> directory contains the expected outputs for each
    data file.
</p>

<img src="./Lab 4 Instructions_files/output_files.png" <="" img="">

<p>
    As mentioned earlier, there are run configurations provided to you that run with each of the
    toy data files.
</p>

<p>
    Look over the code provided for <b>Toyland</b> (in the <b>toyland</b> package).  It already does
    the work of reading the toy file from the command line and creating them.  You need to implement
    the <b>playTime()</b> and <b>displayStatistics()</b> methods.
</p>

<p>
    Be very careful here!  You should only be using <b>IToy</b> in your implementation!  The main
    program is only aware of this interface.  It is intentionally unfamiliar with any
    of the actual toys in the hierarchy.
</p>

<h4>Creating Your Own Toy!</h4>

<p>
    For the final part of the lab, you will create your very own type of toy.  The only requirement
    is that it fits somewhere into the existing toy hierarchy you just finished developing.  Also it
    goes without saying but please make your own toy appropriate and non-offensive.
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        Decide what type of toy you want to create.  Think about what kind of state and special
        play behavior it will have.
    </li>
    <li>
        Create your new toy by completely implementing it.
    </li>
    <li>
        In order to test your toy, you will need to make a data file for it.  Please use the provided
        <tt>mytoy-5.txt</tt> file in the <b>data</b> directory to add your data in.  You will specify
        five different instances of this toy.  Take a look at the other input files to get an idea of
        the format.  The first string must be the name of your toy, followed by its properties.
    </li>
    <li>
        In order to test your new toy, you should use the provided run configuration
        <b>Toyland mytoy-5.txt</b>.   When you first run this you will run into problems
        because all the toys are null.  This is because the toy factory does not initially recognize
        your new toy.
    </li><li>
        To fix this you need to make two additions to <b>ToyFactory</b> in the <b>toys</b> package.
        <ul>
            <li>
                Add your new toy type to the end of the <b>ToyType</b> enum.  The name of the
                enum should match the first strings in the data file.  You should use all
                capitalization.
            </li>
            <li>
                In the factory method, <b>makeToy</b>, you should add a case to deal with
                creating your new toy when a line is encountered that specifies it.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        When finished, you should be able to create five of your toys, play with them until
        they are retired, and then display statistics about them.
    </li>
</ul>

<h4>Lab Submission</h4>

<p>
    Because this is a much larger assignment, we expect more commits.  Ideally you should
    commit and push each time you complete one of the concrete classes and pass all its
    tests.
</p>

<p>
    You need to make sure you create a zip file that contains both your <tt>src</tt> folder,
    as well as your <tt>mytoy-5.txt</tt> data file.  If you are unsure of how to do this,
    first create a new folder on your computer.  First copy the entire <tt>src</tt> directory
    into it, and then copy your new data file into it.  From there you can zip up that new
    directory.
</p>

<p>
    Name the zip file <tt>lab4.zip</tt> and submit it to the dropbox on MyCourses by the due date.
</p>
